What is your picture of a great leader?

A visionary? A role-model? An excellent communicator? A coach? A mentor? Someone, who is not afraid to speak the unspeakable? To take calculated risks? Someone, who can embrace and work with the tension between current reality and the vision? Someone who recognizes and works with multiple perspectives?
